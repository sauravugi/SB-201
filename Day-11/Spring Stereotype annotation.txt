Spring Stereotype annotation :-
Spring Annotations are a form of metadata that provides data about a program. Annotations are used to provide supplemental information about a program. It does not have a direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate. It does not change the action of the compiled program. 
Spring Framework provides us with some special annotations. These annotations are used to create Spring beans automatically in the application context. @Component annotation is the main Stereotype Annotation. There are some Stereotype meta-annotations which is derived from @Component those are :

1. @Service :- We specify a class with @Service to indicate that they’re holding the business logic.
2. @Repository :- We specify a class with @Repository to indicate that they’re dealing with CRUD operations, usually, it’s used with DAO (Data Access Object)                               or Repository implementations that deal with database tables.
3. @Controller :- We specify a class with @Controller to indicate that they’re front controllers and responsible to handle user requests and return the                              appropriate response. It is mostly used with REST Web Services

@Component is a class-level annotation. It is used to denote a class as a Component. We can use @Component across the application to mark the beans as Spring’s managed components. A component is responsible for some operations.

Uses:-
1. Spring Stereotype of annotation that indicates the "role of a class" in a project.
2. These annotations are used to create Spring beans automatically in the application context.

Note: If we are not able to identify a class, from which layer it belongs then we can apply @Component annotation on the top of that class.
